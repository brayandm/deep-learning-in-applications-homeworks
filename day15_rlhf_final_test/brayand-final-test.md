# Deep Learning in Applications Final Test

## Name: Brayan Duran Medina

### 1. RL problem statement. State, Action, Reward, Environment, Agent

### 2. Crossentropy method

### 3. Value function, Q-function

### 4. Q-learning, approximate Q-learning. DQN, bells and whistles (Experience replay, Double DQN, autocorrelation problem)

### 5. Policy gradient and REINFORCE algorithm

-   a. Baseline idea, A2C

### 6. Policy gradient applications in other domains (outside RL). How Self-Critical Sequence Training is performed? What is used as a baseline?
